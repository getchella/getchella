Hello, my name is Alex Getchell, and I am a senior at the University of Pittsburgh studying computer engineering.
I have future aspirations of working as an embedded systems engineer after I graduate in December 2022. I enjoy
working with microcontrollers and utilizing C or C++ to make cool projects.
